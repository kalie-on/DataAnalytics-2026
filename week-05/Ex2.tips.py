# Define known values


food_cost = 79.25
tax = 6.54
tip = 12.00


# Calculate the unknown

total_due = food_cost + tax + tip

# Display the results

print("The total due is " + str(total_due))

# str() is used to convert a number into text (string)
# so it can be combined with other text using +

print("Food cost is " + str(food_cost) + " and tax is " + str(tax))
print("Tip is " + str(tip))

# format() converts the number to a string and ensures
# it shows exactly 2 decimal place
